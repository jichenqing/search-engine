# search-engine

Contributors: Zhiqi Rong, Chenqing Ji

we implemented ranked retrieval search.

Please use View.py to run the GUI Interface for the search engine.

information_retrieval.py is the main retrieval ranking part.

tokenized_invert.py is the part for creating inverted index.

test.py are tokenized functions we use in the process.

We implement cosine similarity, position proximity, field score to do the rankings. Pages of sorted ranking are displayed for the user.
